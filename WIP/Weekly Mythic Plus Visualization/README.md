In the way that design is closely related to art, finding a preferred and consistent design style requires experimentation, a good understanding of your design tools, and constant practice.

The purpose of this project is to develop such a design style.

Currently, this project is meant to focus far more on the developing the aesthetics of a dashboard rather than drawing insights. 

These first few weeks, I intend to simply experiment with the different chart types, and preset styles. Over time, I hope to be able to focus on clear design principles and themes. 

All data for this project is taken from the World of Warcraft M+ leaderboard site, Raider.io. The data has been scraped using the site's API, and contains all M+ dungeon runs from EU and NA of keystone level 25 and above for the current week.

Developer Tools Used: Python (automated running of script, data scraping and cleaning), Tableau (data visualization)

All visualizations may be found on my Tableau Public [here]() or my blog site [here](). It is recommended that you view the webpages on your desktop for the best viewing experience.
