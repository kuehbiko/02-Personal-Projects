# Exploratory Data Analysis of Covid-19 Statistics in SQL and Tableau
The datasets used in this project is taken from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)

In this project, we use Google's BigQuery to explore two covid-19 datasets: covid_deaths and covid_vaccinations. 

In the [data exploration](https://github.com/kuehbiko/covid_19_statistics/blob/main/SQL-Queries-Exploration.sql), we explore statistics such as countries with the highest deaths per population and percent deaths per day globally.
Thereafter, we select [4 queries](https://github.com/kuehbiko/covid_19_statistics/blob/main/SQL-Queries-TableauVisualisation.sql) to use in our dashboard.

Please view the full dashboard on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kuebiko/viz/2020-2021Covid-19Statistics/Dashboard1) as it has interactive filters.

From this dashboard we can see:
- From Jan 2020 to Apr 2021, there have been a total of 150M recorded cases worldwide, and 3.1M recorded deaths
- This makes the death rate of Covid-19 a mere 2.11%
- Europe amassed the most deaths out of all the continents
- However for a single country, the United States are the highest
